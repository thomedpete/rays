#Self Evaluation Arrays

##How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Well I think they are neat and  I feel I have a good understanding of arrays and how to make them. As well as using some methods and calling elements with consol.log.  Took a minute to start  with 0 but I now feel fine with my understanding of index positions.
##Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
No, I really think I got the goal of the lesson, it was fun playing with some of the methods to find out what they do.
##What questions do you have about Arrays?
Well my question was going to be "common applications/ real world use" but the for statements live session cleared that up
